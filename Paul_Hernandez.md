Defined and implemented a software engineering culture based on guiding principles of simplicity, quality, honesty and iteration. Taught developers to practice agile work planning, estimation, prioritization, code review, and test driven development. Mentored and led team members to increase their proficiency in software development tools and skills. 

Automated the delivery of software artifacts via a CI/CD pipeline to deploy software incrementally and consistently, enabling runtime toggling of features via flags. Deployed cloud infrastructure to Kubernetes environments using terraform and devOps/gitOps methodologies. Improved release process from ad-hoc and error prone, to reliable, consistent and automated. 

Implemented a restful api service facade to query data from disparate data sources for reporting and display to the customer, replacing tightly coupled and fragile legacy systems.
